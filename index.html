    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    This week introduced sound as an emotional and perceptual experience that
    can guide interpretation and narrative. I was particularly interested in the
    exercise which played a score and we had to guess what the intended purpose
    was. I wrote it as a somber feeling mixed with hope, like an anticipation
    for something better when everything is wrong. It was nice to hear everyones
    perceptions of what they heard because they were geared towards the same
    sound, but different answers. It was very impressive when someone got the
    exact answer, I think that attests to how well the sound design was made for
    it.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Four Ways of Knowing stood out, especially participatory knowing (the
    knowing of feeling what it is like to be in an experience). Feeling what its
    like to be in a situation is very important with creating sound design
    (especially for films or games), even if youve never been in that situation
    yourself. Although it didn't just underline the importance to me, it also
    made me start thinking more about how the role of sound can be important for
    audiences to participate more emotionally to a piece of media. A lot of my
    personal projects with sound design have been very focused on realism, but I
    never really thought to consider exactly what I am aiming for with it. Am I
    trying to establish realism to make the visual space more believeable and
    draw attention to it? Am I trying to create certain emotions for things that
    haven't happened on screen? The video shown about how sound can change
    someones perception of visual media also led me to think more about it. A
    moment I found interesting was where it explained how sound could shift
    viewer attention, and how people change where they look on the screen based
    on what they can hear. I never really put 2 and 2 together that since I can
    hint towards something sonically, that would change how people perceive the
    visual media, thus changing where they look, maybe anticipating something. I
    just thought that was very interesting that sound can also be a tool to
    guide visual perception.

  <h3>Academic Research</h3>
  I was inspired by how sound could influence perception, and I ended up reading
  this article by Claudia Gorbman (Narrative Film Music), which just talks about
  how music can guide how people interpret narrative meaning. She talked
  specifically about 'unheard melodies' which is basically just how music can
  support narrative meaning in a subtle way, ways that the listener wont really
  realize unless thinking about it. It tied really nicely to what we learnt in
  class. I also went back to this previous paper that I had read previously by
  Chion. He discussed how audio could reflect on visual media in different ways,
  and how you use it is critical. For example, a disconnect in the music can
  create uneasy tension that adds complexity to the visuals, making something
  once seen as normal, into an underlaying feeling of tension.

  <h3>Artistic Research</h3>
  I started to look more deeply into music and emotions tying together,
  listening to my favorite songs and analysing what musically makes me love them
  so much. A specific example is Let Down by Radiohead. Or any radiohead song in
  general. The way that they build atmosphere, the experimental sound, the
  guiding structure, its moody, its spacey. Even i'm not 100% sure the technical
  reasons of why it makes people feel so much. There was a YouTube video I
  watched (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX2hQdcEvyA) that I think explained
  it perfectly, and why it's so good alongside visual media. The use of harmony,
  texture, mood, rhythm. I think its refreshing considering a lot of songs
  nowadays follow certain formulas, but that's a completely different topic that
  I could go into.

  <h3>Technical Research</h3>
  Because of the Gina Moore assignment, i did a lot of research on how to use
  Ableton Live, which is my daw of choice. Experimenting with automation and how
  to make glitches were the highlights. Although I've done it automation before,
  I haven't done it extensively. The more I did it the more shocked I was of how
  it made a difference, especially because if I wanted a sound to go away, I
  just cut it out, but having it play soft in the background added that weight I
  always felt was missing from my sound projects. Learning different ways to
  make glitching sounds was really fun. I layered effects like pitch shifting,
  grain delay and reverb and then used automation to create sudden cuts, fade
  ins and randomized movement, which helped me achieve that glitch texture I was
  looking for.
  <br />
  <br />

  Other than Ableton Live, I actually learnt how to compose a simple orchestra
  piece for this assignment. I recognize that scores aren't my strong suit and I
  wanted to do something that challenged me, especially since the animation I
  chose was around 30 seconds, so I didn't have to make it too long. I watched
  this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdhdC2wx2Ew) which was actually
  extremely helpful and I learnt many new things. I thought the violin and viola
  were basically the same intstrument before this! It was interesting how
  different instruments in brass, woodwind and strings could play the same thing
  and it gave off different emotions and different vibes, even though they were
  in the same frequency spectrum. I particuarly liked the hack of making
  everything on a simple piano, then assigning it to different instruments, I
  definitely think it helped with my workflow as I started focusing more on
  chords and notes and why I wanted to press those, rther than being stuck
  figuring everything all out at once. I would highly reccommend that video to
  anyone looking at how to start with orchestral writing.

  <h3>Progress Report</h3>
  I began by choosing the animation I wanted, then thinking about what direction
  I wanted to go with. This will be written on my report but I originally
  started with a realistic approach but felt that the animation was too
  abstract, and wanted something to fit with that, which is why I chose to do a
  musical score. Of course as mentioned before, I chose to do an orchestral
  piece because of my nonexistent experience. Before watching the video I made
  the mistake of just jumping straigh into, which resulted in a terrible score.
  I just did chords and was playing random lead lines within the key, but it
  sounded terrible:
  <br />
  <br />
  My composition improved greatly after I watched the video. I started with a
  rough piano roll and kept refining it until I had a sound and structure I
  liked which consisted of a lead, a second lead, chords and a bass which was
  all I needed!
  <br />
  <br />
  From this I made different groups of the main instruments of strings, and
  assigned the different parts appropriately. The plugin I used was BBC's
  expressive strings, it was super great and useful and free!
  <br />
  <br />
  then i did the same for brass, using similar mapping techniques to fill out
  the orchestration
  <br />
  <br />
  and then woodwinds.
  <br />
  <br />
  after that it was just a matter of using automation to create structure! Then
  the sound design was finished! Originally it took up the entire time, but when
  I decided that the glitches would turn it into synths, I cut the midi short. I
  used a bunch of random effects tomake the glitch sounds as I mentioend
  earlier, and then to transition, I layered a abunch of the elad lines with
  different sounds and textures to lead into the glitchiness, but also give it
  some melodic strucutre so the change wasn't too jarring! This completed my
  first draft and I'm still refining, but I have a structure I like and an idea
  I like so I am happy.
